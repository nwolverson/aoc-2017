# aoc-2017

[Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) with a language a day. Trying to avoid languages that are flavours of the same thing or overly similar.

Not being strict about taking input vs hard-coding data.

Much of this code is probably very bad, forgive me, it's my first day writing language X.
